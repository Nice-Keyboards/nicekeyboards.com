# Getting Started

## Installing your nice!view

### Using an existing OLED compatible shield

 - Cut off one of the positions of both the socket and header
 - Solder the left over 4 pin socket to your shield
 - Solder the left over 4 pin header to your nice!view's left 4 pins (not the CS pin!)
 - Create a bodge wire from the CS pin to the Arduino Digital 1 (D1) Pro Micro pin (P0.06/006 on the nice!nano)
   - If the D1 pin is unavailable, you'll need to override the `cs-gpios` on the adapter or define your own `&nice_view_spi` bus without the `nice_view_adapter`.
 - Insert the header into the socket

### Using a nice!view native compatible shield

 - Solder the 5 pin socket to your shield
 - Solder the 5 pin header to the nice!view
 - Insert the header into the socket

### Protection Film

The display of the nice!view comes with a protection film installed to protect the display before usage.
You may remove the film after installation or leave it on if you prefer.

## Using with ZMK

After successfully installing your nice!view, all that should be required is to build your board with the `nice_view` shield and possibly the `nice_view_adapter` if you're using a non-native shield.

### ZMK Config Repo

With a ZMK config repo, edit the `build.yaml` file to have `nice_view` added to the end of each shield string.
If you're using an OLED compatible shield, you'll also need to add `nice_view_adapter` to the list of shields *first*.

Native example:
```diff
include:
  - board: nice_nano_v2
-   shield: some_native_shield
+   shield: some_native_shield nice_view
```

Non-native example:
```diff
include:
  - board: nice_nano_v2
-   shield: lily58_left
+   shield: lily58_left nice_view_adapter nice_view
  - board: nice_nano_v2
-   shield: lily58_right
+   shield: lily58_right nice_view_adapter nice_view
```

### Manual ZMK build

When building manually, all that needs to be done is adding `nice_view` to the shield build string.
If you're using an non-native but OLED compatible shield, you'll also need to add `nice_view_adapter` to the list of shields *first*.

Native example:
```diff
- west build -p -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD="some_native_shield"
+ west build -p -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD="some_native_shield nice_view"
```

Non-native shield:
```diff
- west build -p -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD="lily58_left"
+ west build -p -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD="lily58_left nice_view_adapter nice_view"
```
